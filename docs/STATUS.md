# leCoach implementation status

Last updated: 2026-10-07.

This file records verified implementation evidence. Task ownership and progress live in [TASKS.md](../TASKS.md); product scope lives in [GUIDE.md](../GUIDE.md).

## Verified

- GitHub repository: https://github.com/crasni/leCoach.
- Initial bootstrap commit: `5f3eb6b` on `main`, pushed to `origin/main` and verified against the remote commit.
- README, product guide, ignore rules, and three reference PDFs are present.
- At the start of coordination work, `git pull --ff-only` reported already up to date.

## Not implemented or verified

- No application scaffold, runnable product, camera/microphone capture, speech/vision inference, engagement engine, audience UI, or post-session feedback exists yet.
- No model availability, inference latency, local privacy behavior, or UGen300 runtime compatibility has been measured.
- Competition details in GUIDE.md are project context; the latest official requirements have not been rechecked during repository bootstrap or team coordination.
- Event contracts and five role handoffs describe the intended MVP, not implementation evidence.

## Team assignments and access

FACT: On 2026-10-07 the maintainer supplied all five GitHub usernames and authorized assigning them to the five roles. The canonical named roster, task owners, branches, and reported invitation states are now in [TASKS.md](../TASKS.md). Assignment does not imply work has started.

IMPACT: Each onboarded agent can determine its lane from its collaborator's GitHub username. Some repository invitations are still pending according to the supplied roster, so those owners need to accept before pushing work. No collaborator has been messaged or newly invited by this agent.

PROPOSAL: Assigned owners follow the TASKS.md first-task and dependency instructions; the integration owner starts the scaffold. After accepting an invitation, update the access state in TASKS.md. GitHub API authentication is still unavailable here, so invitation acceptance cannot be checked automatically; SSH Git pull/push remains available.

## Evidence to add as work lands

For each completed task, record the commit/PR, exact runnable command, whether inputs are fixtures or live, observed result, and remaining limitation. For hardware measurements also record device, runtime/model version, and measurement method. Record discoveries as FACT / IMPACT / PROPOSAL as GUIDE.md requires.
